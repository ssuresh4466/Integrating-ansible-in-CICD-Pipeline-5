first remove the existing image and container which are created by manually.

Jenkins Console => edit previous job => Configure add the commands in Exec Command blank.
ansible-playbook -i path-of-inventory-file (/opt/docker/hosts) name-of-playbook;
=> save => build => success
here the output should be as following.
war file will be generated and creates image and container in the mentioned host.
now we can access in web. ip:8080/vprofile-v1

if we build the same job again there should be another image and container.
if we enable poll SCM for * * * * * , it can run automatically every minute.
if we modify then only it starts new build.
but it gives UNSTABLE. because it can not create image/container with same name.
so we should delete image/container before building job.
 we do it in next file
