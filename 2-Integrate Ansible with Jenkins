we should have two ec2 instances for this task.
one ec2 for jenkins server and other for ansible server.


(we need to enable ssh connection between jenkins and ansible hosts which is similar to 
ssh connection between jenkins and docker hosts, for this we nonfigure Systems =>
Publish Over SSH and add ssh server.

any name
hostname: ip addr of ansible system.
username: ansadmin(any new user)
Advanced => use password authentication and add password then Test connection.

Now , we need to create new jenkins job , whenever we run that jenkins job 
the artifacts should be copied into that target env.(ansible host)

Job Name:  Deploy_on_Container_using_ansible
add github link and maven build and 
Post build action : Publish Over SSH => select ansible server 
=> webapp/target/*.war (whatever the path in your system)
=> Remote Directory : //opt//docker
sudo chown -R ansadmin:ansadmin /opt/docker in terminal .

now after building that jenkins job the war file appears in /opt/docker path
