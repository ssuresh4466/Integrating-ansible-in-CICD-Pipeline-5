create a dockerhub account.
sign-in
ansible-server :
create image and container using previous playbook.
to push the image into hub:
tag : docker tag simple-devops-image project/simple-devops-image
docker push image name gives error
we should login first
docker login
docker push project/simple-devops-image
then we get the image in github repository.
now even we delete the image in our local system then 
we can pull the image from docker hub.
docker pull project/simple-devops-image
and we can pull the image from docker-host system also
docker-host: docker pull project/simple-devops-image
for that the user ansadmin should be added to docker group as follow.
usermod -aG docker ansadmin
check it by id command
switch to ansadmin
docker pull project/simple-devops-image
and we can create container also here.

but we need to do the same by using ansible playbook, in next file
