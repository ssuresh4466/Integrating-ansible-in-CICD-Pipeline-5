in ansible-server /opt/docker path we have war file and 
now we need to create Dockerfile in same location.

vim Dockerfile
FROM tomcat:latest
MAINTAINER Suresh
COPY ./vprofile-v1.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

this is the same Dockerfile used in docker-server to build the image.

actually next step is to build image and then container in the new node.
we can do manually but we should do it automation by creating yml file.

vim simple-devops-project.yml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: build docker image using war file
    command: docker build -t simple-devops-image .
    args:
      chdir: /opt/docker
vi /opt/docker/hosts
localhost(or any ip)
ansible-playbook -i hosts simple-devops-project.yml --check 
### just to check how the playbook is going to run.
## but it does not actually create image.
ansible-playbook -i hosts simple-devops-project.yml

now run the playbook then we can get image and container.

now we can find the generated docker image.

but it should be executed from the jenkins job itself.

edit the above playbook.
