ansible-server:
cd /opt/docker 
we have playbooks here image.yml and project.yml
now we are executing image.yml in the ansible-server and 
we are limiting the creation of image only to ansible-server.
ansible-playbook -i hosts image.yml --limit localhost
hosts file has localhost and docker-server ip
this playbookcreates new image and 
pull the generated image to dockerhub.
then removes the existed image, 

now the following playbook Limits only to target env.
check available images and containers.
delete if they has same name as our image/container.
ansible-playbook -i hosts project.yml --limit ip-addr-of-docker-server


we can do all this by executing in jenkins job,in next file
